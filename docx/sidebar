##   1>>>>Key Requirements Breakdown
            Domain Check (abc.localhost3000.com):
            Ensure user-specific logic is only applied when running under this domain.

            Feature Lock/Unlock (CRM, HRM, Customer):
            Dynamically show/hide or disable sidebar items based on feature permissions.

            Professional Sidebar Style:

            Add support for a professional blue theme.

            Active tab should be highlighted clearly.

            Fonts must look clean and readable.

>>>>>>>>> step 2 >>>>>>>>> What we're Building
        we’re building a multi-tenant SaaS web app where:

        Each customer (tenant) has their own subdomain (like abc.localhost:3000).

        Each tenant can have different features unlocked, like:

        ✅ CRM

        ✅ HRM

        ✅ Customer

        ❌ Locked ones are hidden or disabled from sidebar.

## >> 🧠 Concept in Simple Words
🔹 Subdomain = Customer
abc.localhost:3000 → customer abc

xyz.localhost:3000 → customer xyz

You detect which customer is using the app by reading the subdomain.
## 🔹 Each customer has custom features
You store the feature settings (what to show/hide) in the backend:

Customer	CRM	HRM	Customer
abc	✅	❌	✅
xyz	✅	✅	❌
