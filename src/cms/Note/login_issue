<!-- #1 What Does “Isolate Auth per Subdomain” Mean? -->
When you use multiple tenants like abc.localhost and mkf.localhost, they might share the same localStorage or cookies, especially during development on localhost.

🔴 Example of the Problem:
You log in as mkf.localhost, store token in access_token

Then open abc.localhost, it also reads the same access_token

That's why abc.localhost is using mkf.localhost's token
