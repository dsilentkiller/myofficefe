Key Changes:
Child Route Paths: Changed the paths for employee, employee/create, customer, and customer/create to be relative, rather than starting with a /.
Explanation:
When nesting routes under /user, the child routes should not start with a / because that makes them absolute paths. Instead, they should be relative to the parent path (/user). This allows React Router to correctly resolve them as nested routes under /user.
This should resolve the runtime error you were encountering.

 Check Route Path Configuration
Verify that the EmployeeList component is correctly imported and that the route path is correctly defined.
The path should be "employee" and not "/employee" to ensure it's relative to the parent /user route.
